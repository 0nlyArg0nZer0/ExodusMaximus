# AssaultCube 1.3.0.2 Game Hacking Project

A C++ project designed for educational purposes, focused on learning reverse engineering and memory manipulation through hacking AssaultCube 1.3.0.2. This project demonstrates how to interact with and modify game memory to implement features like infinite health, unlimited ammo, speed hacks, and more. Ideal for those who want to deepen their understanding of game internals, memory reading/writing, and hacking techniques, all while maintaining ethical boundaries by using it for personal practice only.




# Overview

This project demonstrates how to interact with the memory of AssaultCube 1.3.0.2 using C++. The goal is to practice skills like:

    Memory reading and writing (RreadProcessMemory & WriteProcessMemory)
    Pointer manipulation
    Injection of custom code into running processes
    Reverse engineering basics





The main focus is on learning how to locate important game data in memory and change it to affect the game (e.g., giving yourself infinite health, ammo, etc.).
